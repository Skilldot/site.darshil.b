          <h2>What’s Included in Each Service?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Static Website (1-page):</strong> A clean, responsive single-page website designed using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. Ideal for personal profiles, portfolios, or small business overviews. Includes custom styling, mobile compatibility, a contact form (if needed), and GitHub Pages hosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Static Website (multi-page):</strong> A full static website with multiple linked pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact). Consistent design across pages, basic responsive layout, clean navigation, and GitHub Pages hosting. Good for personal brands, small businesses, or informational websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Blog Setup & Styling:</strong> I help you build a simple blog layout using static tools or raw HTML/CSS. This includes a homepage that links to blog posts, consistent post layout styling, custom fonts and color themes, and GitHub Pages deployment. Great for writers and learners.</li>
            <li><strong>Landing Page:</strong> A visually focused, scrollable one-page website designed to highlight a product, event, or service. Includes structured sections like headline, features, testimonials, call-to-action (CTA) buttons, and contact info. Mobile responsive and styled for clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Writing:</strong> Clear, original writing for blogs, web pages, or informational posts. I can tailor the tone (casual, formal, instructional, etc.) to suit the target audience. Includes formatting for readability, basic SEO structuring (headings, keyword focus), and revisions to match your voice.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Revisions:</strong> While basic revisions are free, this covers major layout changes, rewriting entire sections, or large design/style overhauls after initial delivery. This ensures flexibility while respecting both time and scope.</li>

          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How do I request a service?</strong><br>Email me directly or use the contact form on my main site (if available). I’ll respond within 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>How long will a project take?</strong><br>Depends on complexity. Most single-page sites and content writing tasks are completed within 3–5 days.</li>
            <li><strong>How do payments work?</strong><br>Upfront or milestone-based via agreed method (UPI/PayPal/etc.). I’ll confirm the method when we finalize the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Can I see examples of your work?</strong><br>Yes! Visit my main site for live previews of past work and blog posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Are revisions included?</strong><br>Basic revisions are free. Substantial changes after delivery may fall under 'Additional Revisions' and be billed separately.</li>
